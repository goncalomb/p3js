# P3 CPU #

The P3 is a 16 bit CPU used at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST) as a learning tool for Computer Engineering students.

It is described in chapters 10, 11 and 12 of the book:

> Arquitectura de Computadores: Dos Sistemas Digitais aos Microprocessadores  
> G. Arroz, J. Monteiro, A. Oliveira  
> IST Press

The P3 itself is not a commercial product and doesn't exist as a dedicated IC. It is normally implemented on an FPGA or simulated on a computer.

_Not to be confused with The Pentium III._
