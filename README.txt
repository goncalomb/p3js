p3js

p3js will be an assembler and simulator for the P3 CPU written in JavaScript.

The P3 is a 16bit CPU designed at IST, it is used as a learning tool for
Computer Engineering students.

This is a work in progress.


Road Map

* Create test website (for fast local prototyping and testing);
* Create assembly parser;
* Create assembler (outputs object file);
* Improve website, allow download of object file, to run on other simulators.
* Deploy website at this poit? Without simulator?
* Create simulator's internal logic (memory, interrupts, control ROMs etc.);
* Add simulator GUI (in HTML);
* Add switch board and console simulation (and GUI);
