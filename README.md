# P3JS #

The P3JS is a JavaScript assembler and simulator for the P3 CPU.

The P3 is a 16-bit CPU used at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) (IST) as a learning tool for Computer Engineering students. Check [p3doc on GitHub Pages](https://goncalomb.github.io/p3doc/) for more information about the CPU itself.

This repository contains an API and 2 implementations (web and terminal).

## Online Assembler and Simulator (web) ##

If you just want to use the assembler and simulator NOW, go to [p3js.goncalomb.com](http://p3js.goncalomb.com/).

## Local Installation and Usage ##

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
* Download the source code from this repository.
* Run `npm install` to download the dependencies and build everything.

### Assembler and Simulator (web)

* Run `npm start` to start a dev-server and open your default browser.
* OR open `www/index.html` on your browser (you won't be able to load the demos this way).

This still requires an Internet connection when first opening the browser. Running `node install-offline.js` will download the required remote files and create a new file, `www/index-offine.html` that doesn't require Internet connection.

### Assembler (terminal) `node p3as.js`

To assemble a program: `node p3as.js YOUR_PROGRAM.as`.

#### Command-line options

* `-o OUTPUT_FILE` to set a custom output file (defaults to YOUR_PROGRAM.exe);
* `--show-refs` to show the references;

### Simulator (terminal) `node p3sim.js`

To run a program on the simulator: `node p3sim.js YOUR_PROGRAM.as` (it also assembles the program).

#### Controls

* `Ctrl-A`: change the keyboard focus between the terminal (TERM), interruptions (INT) and the switches (SWT);
* `Ctrl-C`: exit the simulator;
* `Ctrl-R`: reset the simulator;
* `Ctrl-S`: start/stop the simulator;

#### Keyboard Focus (Ctrl-A)

* `TERM`: sends keystrokes to the terminal;
* `INT`: use the keys 0-9 and A-F to trigger interrupts;
* `SWT`: use the keys 0-7 toggle the switches;

## Roadmap ##

* **P3JS** (src/p3js/):
    * Cleanup and modularize the parser and assembler;
    * Implement Web Worker API (simulator/cpu) to take advantage of multiple threads (maybe?), make some performance tests first;
* **Local Assembler** (p3as.js):
    * Cleanup the code;
    * Add option to output references to a file;
    * Add option to output raw memory image;
    * Add option to allow custom instructions (requires API code first);
* **Local Simulator** (p3sim.js):
    * Cleanup the code;
    * Add option to load memory;
    * Add option to set custom ROMs;
    * Add help screen;
